# Everything Front End Guide
This is a guide that everyone can use to learn about the practice of front-end development. It broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering: how to learn it and where to learn it in 2020.

The materials referenced and discussed here are either best in class or the current offering to a problem. The idea behind this is to create a centralized all-in-one documentation to house all the different resources I have been utilizing to enhance my front-end development skills on a routine basis.
